        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What is The Stoa of AI?</summary>
          <p>The Stoa of AI is a membership community focused on AI, led by three founders (Zeneca, A Fox, and Frank Zuuring), offering research, education, community, and alpha at the frontier of artificial intelligence.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What does "Founding Member" mean?</summary>
          <p>Founding Members are the first to join The Stoa of AI. They lock in the introductory price of $9/month (or $90/year) forever — the price will increase for future members. Annual founding members also get a Founding Member badge and special recognition within the community.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Will the price really go up?</summary>
          <p>Yes. $9/month (or $90/year) is the founding member price. Once the founding period ends, the price increases. Founding members keep their rate locked in permanently.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Do I need technical AI knowledge to join?</summary>
          <p>Not at all. Whether you're a complete beginner, someone already experimenting with AI tools, or a technical expert — The Stoa of AI is designed to meet you where you are and help you level up.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Who are the founders?</summary>
          <p>The Stoa of AI is led by three founders. Zeneca is one of the most respected voices in the crypto/Web3 space, known for building large communities and identifying trends early. A Fox is a Web3 educator and cofounder of TokenPage, with a newsletter reaching over 22,000 subscribers. Frank Zuuring runs AMTEX Digital, bringing 30+ years of tech experience and deep expertise in AI agent implementation. Together, they bring a unique blend of community-building and technical expertise.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can I cancel anytime?</summary>
          <p>Yes. There are no long-term contracts. You can cancel your membership at any time. However, if you cancel your founding membership, the locked-in rate is not guaranteed upon rejoining.</p>
